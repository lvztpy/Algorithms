## Data structure

*array*

*linked list*

Josphus Problem is an interesting problem

*Pushdown stacks*
   restricted-access data structure,only two operations: **push**insert at the beginning or **pop**remove it from the beginning.
   
 operations : insert, delete, access
 *postfix* *infix* 
   
*queue*

another restricted-access data structure:
two operation: **insert** at the beginning
               **remove** at the end
**First in , First out**

## Abstract data type ##

It is often convenient to describe algorithms and data sturcture *in terms of the operations performed*, rather than in terms of implementation.

*sorting*  and *searching*

One abstract data type can be used to define another: use linked list and arrays to define *stacks* and *queues*.

The real power of the abstract data type concept is that it allows us conveniently to construct large system on different levels of abstraction, from machine level to high level programming language.
